# Email Spam Detection Project

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting email spam using machine learning techniques. It consists of two major steps:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset through visualization and statistics.
2. **Model Building**: Implementing a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam.

## Project Structure
- `EDA.ipynb`: Contains the exploratory data analysis, including data loading, cleaning, and visualizations to understand spam email patterns.
- `Spam Detection-checkpoint.ipynb`: Includes the machine learning model implementation for spam classification using Scikit-learn.

## Dataset
- The dataset used is `spamclass.csv`, which includes labeled data for spam and non-spam emails.

## Libraries Used
- `Scikit-learn`
- `NumPy`
- `Pandas`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Seaborn`

## Instructions to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Email-Spam-Detection.git
